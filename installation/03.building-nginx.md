#building nginx form source and adding modules

--> before get into once again update the ubuntu using 

            apt-get update

--> downloading the latest nginx source code.

        usefull website:-
            1. http://nginx.org/
            2. https://www.nginx.com/

--> open up the above two links 

--> in nginx.org in the right panel --> go to downloads section.

--> then you will see three sections namely mainline, stable and other versions.

--> in this project we are gonna using the mainline version

--> copy the link address from th emainline section which is available just right ti the changes link
            it may look like this for you

                	nginx-1.15.5 (http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.15.5.tar.gz) (note:- you may see different versions)

--> then return back to your terminal and get the tar files from the above link using the following command.

                        wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.15.5.tar.gz

--> check the contents of the directory using the following command

                    ls -l

--> extract the above tar format using following command

                tar -zxvf nginx-1.15.5.tar.gz

--> list the extracted files  using following command

                ls -l

--> then you will be seeing the folder like this nginx-1.15.5/

--> navigate into that direatory using the following command

            cd nginx-1.15.5/

--> then run the following command to configure the nginx source directory
            
            ./configure

--> now you may see that c compiler is not foud , yes this is the expected error , lets move on to rectifying this error using the following commands.

                apt-get install build essential

--> now try to run the above nginx configuration script using the fillowing command

                ./configure

--> again you will be seeing that there is some libraries missing out there, to get rid of this error use the following command to download that essential packages.

                        apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev

--> now run the nginx configuration script using follwing command

                ./configure

--> now it should compile successfully , lets move onto the next step

--> the following command is used to setup the path for custom configuration for nginx server

        ./configure --sbin-path=/usr/bin.nginx --conf-path=etc.nginx/nginx.conf --error-log-path=/var/log/nginx/error.log --http-log-path=/var/log/nginx/access.log --with-pcre --pid-path=/var/run/nginx.pid --with-http_ssl_module

        reference for each path is available in the follwing link

            http://nginx.org/en/docs/configure.html

--> now we can comile the confifuration sources by executing the following command

                make

    (this comand takes  consumes quite a bit of time)

--> now install the compile source using the following command

                make install

--> check whether you have got the nginx executables using the following command

            ls -l /etc/nginx/

--> now test the ngix installed version usign the following command

                nginx -v

-->  we can now start the nginx server using the following command 

                nginx


--> now check the process is running using previusly mentioned command

        ps aux | grep nginx

--> now check your browser using your inet adress whether nginx is started successfully

        inet address of your's may look like this  139.59.19.185 (not as the same) you can find your inet address using following command

                    ifconfig


--> on the next article we will create a system services to manage our nginx server
